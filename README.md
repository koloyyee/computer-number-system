# Computer Number System
Our world works in base 10, that means 10 is the max and 0 is the lowest,
however, the our computer see differently, because it only sees 0s and 1s, as a softare developer learn the how to convert from one number system to another is crucial.
PLUS! if you go to any traditional wet market in Hong Kong, Taiwan or China you might always need to know how to convert catty(base 16) to metric (base 10)!

## Goal
The goal is to convert the number from one base to another, but I would to show the steps, not just the answer, and that's whole point, but why you might ask.
Because learning is not about knowing the answer to but understand the steps to get to the answer, so next time when we are facing the same problem we know exactly what to do.

## How to start?

# Computer Numbers System Converter


Computer Numbers System is widely use and taught in the field of Computer Science,
the ability to change between different number system is a fundamental skill of a computer programming,
or computer science student.

## Why?
Though it is important but for a mature student and bad in math like myself I struggle on understanding how the system works,
unlike my pass I will simply give up, I would like to tackle the problem by creating a tutorial for students in need, just like myself.

## Who?
This a pet project for anyone who wants to learn the computer number system (CNS) convertion such as binary to octal, decimal to hexadecimal, or anyone who is curious. I would also like to thank the some YouTuber that made videos teaching CNS convertion, and please find their channels and videos in the links down in the "Source" section.

If you are interest playing with this project feel to `git clone` it and run
```javascript
pnpm install
# or 
npm install
```
